symbol,CRS,DMC,note
Fe,2,d↔d,intra-d competition; sensitive to ligand field and oxidation state
Ni,2,d↔d,d–d competition and redox states under U; catalysis-relevant
Pt,3,SOC,heavy 5d: strong SOC/relativistic effects; frequent reordering
Au,3,SOC,heavy 5d: relativistic effects dominate chemical behavior
Co,2,SC,HS↔LS crossover is common; depends on ligand-field strength
